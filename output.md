**THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE—1776:**

</center>

**IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776**

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united  
States of America

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,—That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.—Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.—  
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant

*The delegates of the United Colonies of New Hampshire; Massachusetts Bay; Rhode Island and Providence Plantations; Connecticut; New York; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; New Castle, Kent, and Sussex, in Delaware; Maryland; Virginia; North Carolina, and South Carolina, in Congress assembled at Philadelphia, according to the Order of May 17, to agree upon the respective Assemblies and conventions of the United Colonies, where no government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs, had been established, to adopt such a government as should, in the opinion of the representatives of the people, best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular, and of America in general. A preamble to this resolution, agreed to on the 15th of May, stated the intention of the body to suppress every kind of authority under the British crown.*

*On the 7th of June, certain resolutions respecting independence, were moved and seconded. On the 10th of June it was resolved, that a committee should be appointed to prepare a declaration to the following effect: "That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown; and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved." On the day last mentioned, it was determined that the committee for preparing the declaration should consist of five, when Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Adams, Mr. Franklin, Mr. Sherman, and Mr. R. Livingston, on the 11th of June, Mr. Jefferson was appointed to submit a committee to prepare and digest the form of a confederation to be entered into between these colonies, and report back to Congress. These were to be composed of thirteen powers. On the 12th of June, it was completed that a committee of Congress should be appointed by the members, a board of war and ordernance, to consist of many persons. On the 23rd of June, a declaration of the rights of the members, and their provincial conference, expressing their willingness to present some votes declaring the Colonies were free and independent. This was laid before Congress. On the 28th of June, the committee appointed to prepare a declaration of independence brought in a draught, which was read, and ordered to be published. On the 28th of July, a resolution of the convention of Maryland, passed the 28th of June, authorizing the delegates of that colony to concur in declaring the United Colonies free and independent States, was laid before Congress and read. On the same day Congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole, to take into consideration the resolution respecting independence. On the 2nd of July, a resolution declaring the colonies free and independent States, was adopted. A declaration to that effect was adopted on the following days, taken from the commission. Finally, on the 4th of July, the declaration of Independence as prepared, on engrossed on paper, signed by all those assembled, and directed to be sent to the several Assemblies, conventions, and committees of the council of safety, and to the several commanding officers of the continental land and sea forces, and to be proclaimed in each of the United States, at the head of the Army. It was also ordered to be entered upon the Journals of Congress, and on the 4th of July, engrossed parchment was signed by all but one of the fifty-six signers whose names are appended to that copy as they stand.*

*Rhode Island, New Hampshire. Those of the six names that were absent and signed the privilege of signing it. Resigned, who signed it on the 2nd of August were absent when it was adopted.*

from the depository of their public Records, for  
the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compl-  
iance with his measures.  
He has dissolved Representative Houses re-  
peatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his  
invasions on the rights of the people.  
He has refused for a long time, after such dis-  
solutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby  
the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihila-  
tion, have returned to the People at large for  
their exercise; the State remaining in the mean  
time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from  
without, and convulsions within.  
He has endeavoured to prevent the population  
of these States; for that purpose obstructing the  
Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing  
to pass others to encourage their migrations  
hither, and raising the conditions of new Appro-  
priations of Lands.  
He has obstructed the Administration of Jus-  
tice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for estab-  
lishing Judiciary powers.  
He has made Judges dependent on his Will  
alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the  
amount and payment of their salaries.  
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and  
sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our peo-  
ple, and eat out their substance.  
He has kept among us, in times of peace,  
Standing Armies without the Consent of our le-  
gislatures.  
He has affected to render the Military inde-  
pendent of and superior to the Civil power.  
He has combined with others to subject us to  
a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and  
unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent  
to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops  
among us:  
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from  
punishment for any Murders which they should  
commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the  
world:  
For imposing Taxes on us without our Con-  
sent:  
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits  
of Trial by Jury:  
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried  
for pretended offenses:  
For abolishing the free System of English  
Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing  
therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging  
its Boundaries so as to render it at once an ex-  
ample and fit instrument for introducing the  
same absolute rule into these Colonies:  
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our  
most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally  
the Forms of our Governments:  
For suspending our own Legislatures, and de-  
claring themselves invested with power to legis-  
late for us in all cases whatsoever.  
He has abdicated Government here, by declar-  
ing us out of his Protection and waging War  
against us.  
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts,  
burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our  
people.  
He is at this time transporting large Armies of  
foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of  
death, desolation and tyranny, already begun

with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely  
paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and to-  
tally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.  
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken  
Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against  
their Country, to become the executioners of  
their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves  
by their Hands.  
He has excited domestic insurrections  
amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the  
inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless In-  
dian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an  
undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes  
and conditions.  
In every stage of these Oppressions We have  
Petitioned for Redress in the most humble  
terms: Our repeated Petitions have been an-  
swered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose  
character is thus marked by every act which  
may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of  
a free people.  
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our  
British brethren. We have warned them from  
time to time of attempts by their legislature to  
extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.  
We have reminded them of the circumstances of  
our emigration and settlement here. We have  
appealed to their native justice and magnanimi-  
ty, and we have conjured them by the ties of  
our common kindred to disavow these usurpa-  
tions, which, would inevitably interrupt our  
connections and correspondence. They too have  
been deaf to the voice of justice and of con-  
sanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the  
necessity, which denounces our Separation, and  
hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, En-  
emies in War, in Peace Friends.  
WE, THEREFORE, the Representatives of the  
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in General Congress,  
Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of  
the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do,  
in the Name, and by Authority of the good Peo-  
ple of these Colonies, solemnly publish and de-  
clare, That these United Colonies are, and of  
Right ought to be FREE AND INDEPENDENT  
STATES; that they are Absolved from all Alle-  
giance to the British Crown, and that all politi-  
cal connection between them and the State of  
Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dis-  
solved; and that as Free and Independent States,  
they have full Power to levy War, conclude  
Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,  
and to do all other Acts and Things which Inde-  
pendent States may of right do. And for the sup-  
port of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on  
the protection of divine Providence, we mutu-  
ally pledge to each other our Lives, our Fort-  
unes and our sacred Honor.

Note.—Mr. Ferdinand Jefferson, Keeper of the Rolls in the De-  
partment of State, at Washington, says: "The names of the sign-  
ers are spelt above as in the fac-simile of the original; but the  
punctuation of them is not always the same; neither do the  
names of the States appear in the fac-simile of the original. The  
names of the signers of each State are grouped together in the  
fac-simile of the original, except the name of Matthew Thorn-  
ton, which follows that of Oliver Wolcott."
