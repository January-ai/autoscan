Autoscan is a tool for automatically creating **Markdown** from **PDF** files. Yes, you heard it *right*.

## Markdown (Subheading)

In case you are wondering, Markdown is an easy to use *markup* language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

How cool is that!

The nice thing is that Markdown can also support tables.

| City     | Population       | Size          |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| New York | Too many people! | Not big enough|
| Toronto  | Too many people! | Big enough    |
| IDK      |                  |               |

Markdown can also display math equations and formulas using plugins like Katex.
