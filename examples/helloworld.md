Autoscan is a tool for converting PDFs faithfully to markdown that LLMs can process easily.

Here's an image:

**Image Description**: The image depicts a beautifully decorated outdoor wedding altar by the sea. The altar is flanked by large classical columns wrapped in sheer blue fabric. The top is adorned with white flowers. The setting overlooks the ocean, and the ground is covered with a blue carpet. There are trees and stone architecture surrounding the scene.

Let's use headings.

# Auto Scan

Autoscan is a tool for automatically creating **Markdown** from **PDF** files. Yes, you heard it *right*.

## Markdown (Subheading)

In case you are wondering, Markdown is an easy to use *markup* language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

How cool is that!

Here's another image.

**Image Description**: The image displays a fluffy white kitten sitting by a window. The kitten is looking to the side with bright eyes, and there is a small orange pumpkin placed on the window sill beside it. The background is softly blurred, giving a serene and calm atmosphere.

The nice thing is that Markdown can also support tables.

| City    | Population        | Size          |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| New York| Too many people!  | Not big enough|
| Toronto | Too many people!  | Big enough    |
| IDK     |                   |               |

Markdown can also display math equations and formulas using plugins like Katex.
