# Hello AutoScan, Most Accurate PDF to Markdown

AutoScan converts PDFs into clean Markdown so you can focus on using your documents, not wrestling with them. It extracts text, handles images, and even decodes handwriting - without you pulling your hair out.

Let's see what it can do.

## Transcribe Images

Most LLMs are designed to process text. While they can process images, it can increase costs and latency. AutoScan transcribes images to text to make it easier for LLMs to understand.

> **Image Description**: This image shows a graph of the function $$\( f(x) = \frac{x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8}{4} \)$$. The graph is a cubic curve that crosses the x-axis multiple times. The x-axis is labeled from -5 to 5, and the y-axis is labeled from -5 to 5.

## Ability to Handle Handwritten Text

AutoScan can also read handwriting.

> **Image Description**: The image shows a handwritten excerpt from the carol "Good King Wenceslas" on lined paper. The text reads:
> - Good King Wenceslas looked out,
> - On the Feast of Stephen,
> - When the snow lay round about,
> - Deep and crisp and even;
> - Brightly shone the moon that night,
> - Though the frost was cruel,
> - When a poor man came in sight,
> - Gathering winter fuel.
