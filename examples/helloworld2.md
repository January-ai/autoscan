# Hello AutoScan, Most Accurate PDF to Markdown

AutoScan converts PDFs into clean **Markdown** so you can focus on using your documents, not wrestling with them. It extracts text, handles images, and even decodes handwriting - without you pulling your hair out.

Let's see what it can do.

## Transcribe Images

Most LLMs are designed to process text. While they can process images, it can increase costs and latency. AutoScan transcribes images to text to make it easier for LLMs to understand.

> **Image Description**: This image displays a graph of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8}{4} \). The X-axis ranges from -5 to 5, and the Y-axis ranges from -5 to 5. The graph shows a cubic curve that starts below the X-axis, crosses it several times, and forms peaks and troughs. Key points include a peak at approximately (-3, 4) and a trough at approximately (1, -3).

## Ability to Handle Handwritten Text

Autoscan can also read handwriting.

> **Image Description**: Handwritten text on lined paper. The text is a stanza from the Christmas carol "Good King Wenceslas." The handwriting is in cursive style.

> Good King Wenceslas looked out,  
> On the Feast of Stephen,  
> When the snow lay round about,  
> Deep and crisp and even;  
> Brightly shone the moon that night,  
> Though the frost was cruel,  
> When a poor man came in sight,  
> Gathering winter fuel.
