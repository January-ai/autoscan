# Hello AutoScan, Most Accurate PDF to Markdown

AutoScan converts PDFs into clean **Markdown** so you can focus on using your documents, not wrestling with them. It extracts text, handles images, and even decodes handwriting - without you pulling your hair out.

Let's see what it can do.

## Transcribe Images

Most LLMs are designed to process text. While they can process images, it can increase costs and latency. AutoScan transcribes images to text to make it easier for LLMs to understand.

> **Image Description**: This image displays a graph of the function $$\( f(x) = x^4 - \frac{3x^3}{4} - 6x - 8 \)$$. The graph is plotted on a coordinate plane with x and y axes. The function creates a curve with a local maximum around $$\( x = -3 \)$$ and a local minimum near $$\( x = -1 \)$$. The curve crosses the x-axis at several points and extends towards negative infinity as $$\( x \)$$ decreases and towards positive infinity as $$\( x \)$$ increases.

## Ability to Handle Handwritten Text

Autoscan can also read handwriting.

> **Image Description**: A handwritten page featuring the lyrics to "Good King Wenceslas." The text is written in cursive on lined paper. It reads:
> 
> Good King Wenceslas looked out,  
> On the Feast of Stephen,  
> When the snow lay round about,  
> Deep and crisp and even;  
> Brightly shone the moon that night,  
> Though the frost was cruel,  
> When a poor man came in sight,  
> Gathering winter fuel.
