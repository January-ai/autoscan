# Hello AutoScan, Most Accurate PDF to Markdown

AutoScan converts PDFs into clean **Markdown** so you can focus on using your documents, not wrestling with them. It extracts text, handles images, and even decodes handwriting - without you pulling your hair out.

Let's see what it can do.

## Transcribe Images

Most LLMs are designed to process text. While they can process images, it can increase costs and latency. AutoScan transcribes images to text to make it easier for LLMs to understand.

> **Image Description**: This image displays a graph of the function $$f(x) = x^4 - \frac{3x^3}{4} - 6x - 8$$. The X-axis is labeled from -5 to 5, and the Y-axis is labeled from -5 to 5. The graph shows a curve with varying slopes and intersects the Y-axis at -8.

## Ability to Handle Handwritten Text

Autoscan can also read handwriting.

```
Good King Wenceslas looked out,
On the Feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even;
Brightly shone the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.
```
